<h1>Delorean: Interpolation Preview</h1>


<img src="Delorean_sample_anm.gif" style="max-width: 600px" />

<p>This extension shows an interpolation preview of the current glyph using two open fonts.</p>

<h2>A Window to the Future</h2>

<p>The preview window will update as you adjust contours while drawing so you can avoid surpises down the road. It's not meant for final interpolation, but works like a little window into your future interpoaltion process.</p>

<h2>Initial Values</h2>

<p>Delorean interpolates between Font [1] (Interpolation 0%) and Font [2] (Interpolation 100%). Font[1] is your CurrentFont() when Delorean is launched and Font [2] is the one right behind it. The initial interpolation value is set to 50. Delorean will display your CurrentGlyph() or you can type a glyph name into the "Glyph Name" box. The glyph must of course exist in both fonts, and the glyphs in both fonts must be compatible for interpolation.</p>

<h2>Compatiblity</h2>

<p>The glyphs must be compatible for interpolation to work with Delorean, as with any other interpolation process. If the glyphs aren't compatible, I would recommend using <a href="http://tools.typesupply.com/prepolator.html">Prepolator</a>. For final interpolation and for previewing multi-axis interpolation I would recommend using a more robust application like <a href="http://superpolator.com/">Superpolator</a> which has many more advanced features.</p>
